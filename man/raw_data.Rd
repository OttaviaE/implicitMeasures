\title{Dataset with one IAT and two SC-IATs}
\format{A dataframe with 6 variables, as follows:
  \itemize{
   \item Participant. Participants ID.
   \item latency. Latency of the response times in millisecond.
   \item correct. Response accuracy (0--correct, 1--error).
   \item trialcode. Factor with 32 levels identifying the trial for each
           response, both for the implicit measures and the demographic
           questionnaire. It contains also the trials that have to be
           eliminated, defined as follows:
