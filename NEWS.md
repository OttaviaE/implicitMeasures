# implicitMeasures 0.1.1

* Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.

Changes: 

* Both `clean_iat()` and `clean_sciat()` functions are now able to recognize and deal with data sets imported from SPSS
* There was a mistake in a column name resulting from the `Dsciat()` fucntion. Now it is solved and works properly.
