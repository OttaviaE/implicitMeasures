A bibliography was added to the README file (file "paper.bib"). ALl vignettes have been corrected to make them more clear and understandable. 
A new folder ("joss") was added at the top level. The folder contains a paper about the package that is going to be submitted to the Journal of Open Source Software. 
The presence of these two new files at the top level produces the note.
